## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Finding Health in a Game

Let's say you have 100 health points:

1. Attach to the game process
2. Set Scan Type: EXACT_VALUE
3. Set Data Type: INTEGER
4. Enter Value: 100
5. Click "First Scan"
6. Take damage in the game (e.g., now you have 75 health)
7. Change Value to: 75
8. Click "Next Scan"
9. Repeat until you find the correct address
10. Click "Edit" and set health to 999
11. Click "Freeze" to maintain maximum health

### Scenario 2: Finding Currency

For money/coins that change frequently:

1. Note your current money (e.g., 500)
2. First Scan for 500
3. Spend or earn money (e.g., now 475)
4. Set Scan Type: CHANGED_VALUE
5. Click "Next Scan"
6. Repeat buying/selling and scanning
7. When you find it, edit to desired amount

### Scenario 3: Unknown Initial Value

When you don't know the current value:

1. Set Scan Type: UNKNOWN_INITIAL
2. Set Data Type: INTEGER (or FLOAT for decimals)
3. Click "First Scan" (this will find ALL integers)
4. Set Scan Type: INCREASED_VALUE or DECREASED_VALUE
5. Make the value change in the game
6. Click "Next Scan"
7. Repeat until few results remain

2. Click "Go" to view that address
3. Use "Prev" and "Next" to navigate

### Hex Editor

**Edit Raw Memory:**
1. Go to "Hex Editor" tab
2. Enter the address you want to edit
3. Set the size to read (default: 256 bytes)
4. Click "Load"
5. Edit the hex values directly
6. Click "Save" to write changes

### Disassembler

## Tips & Tricks

### Getting Better Scan Results

1. **Start Specific**: Use EXACT_VALUE when you know the value
2. **Use Data Types**: Choose the correct type (INTEGER for whole numbers, FLOAT for decimals)
3. **Multiple Scans**: Don't expect to find it on the first scan
4. **Change Values**: Make the value change in a controlled way
5. **Scan Types**: Use CHANGED/UNCHANGED to filter results

### Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Scanning**: Use "PARALLEL" scan method for faster scans
2. **Limit Results**: The app limits to 10,000 results by default
3. **Close Unused Tabs**: Free up resources
4. **Detach When Done**: Detach from processes you're not using

### Troubleshooting

**"Failed to attach to process":**
- Run as administrator
- Check if process has anti-cheat protection
- Some system processes cannot be accessed

**"No results found":**
- Check if you're using the correct data type
- Try FLOAT instead of INTEGER (or vice versa)
- Value might be stored differently (e.g., multiplied by 10)
- Try Unknown Initial Value scan

**"Access denied" when reading memory:**
- Some regions are protected
- Try a different scan method
- Some processes have memory protection

**Application crashes:**
- Update all dependencies
- Check Windows Event Viewer for details
- Run with logging enabled
